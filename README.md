## Directions For Use

### 1. Clone the repository, but with different name ####

```sh
git clone <repo_link> <new_name>
```
**For Example**

```sh
git clone git@github.com/spazevic/Auth_Boiler.git shiny-new-project
```
### 2. Install modules from package.json ###

```sh
npm i
```
### 3. Customize for new project ###

Remove the defaulty stuff. For example:

* Title in `layout.ejs`
* Logo field in the nav bar
* Description and Repository fields in package.json
* Remove this boilerplate's readme content
* Switch Favicon (Logo in tab)

### 4. Create a new database for the new project ###

```sh
createdb <new_db_name>
```

### 5. Alter Sequelize Config File ###

In `config/config.json`, update the database name to the one created in step 4. Check other settings, username, password, and dialect.

### 6. Check user model for relevence to new project's needs ###

For example, if new project doesn't need birthday field, delete from user model and user migration files

### 7. Run the sequelize migrations ###
```sh
sequelize db:migrate
```

### 8. Create a file for the enviornment varibles

```sh
touch .env
```

Or create in text editor

Include the following .env varibles:

* SESSION_SECRET - the key for the sesion to use

### 9. Run the server and make sure it works ###

```sh
nodemon or node index.js
```
### 10. Delete the old origin that points to the boilerplate repo ###

Currently if we run this command

```sh
git remote -v 
```

It will show origin as being hooked up to boilerpalte repo. Need fresh repo still. Delete origin remote.

```sh
git remote remove origin
```

### 11. Create an empty git repo ###

Via the Github website follow directions to make new repo

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'First commit'
git remote add origin <new_repo link>
git push origin master
```
